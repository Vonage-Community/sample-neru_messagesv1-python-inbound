# Receiving and Sending SMS Messages Using NeRu, Python and the Messages API (V1)

This project shows how to use NeRu and Python to receive and send SMS messages with the Messages API V1.

## Receive Inbound SMS Webhooks

To receive inbound SMS messages to your NeRu applications you will need to update your API Settings on the Vonage Dashboard to send inbound SMS webhooks to the Messages API:

## Running the project

Create a Vonage Application if you do not have one already, and [link a phone number](https://dashboard.nexmo.com) to the application:

```sh
neru app create --name "neru application"  
```

Then initialize NeRu, choosing the `python` for runtime and `skip` for the template:

```sh
neru init
```

This will create a `neru.yml` file for you, then add the entrypoints:

```yml
project:
    name: $YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
instance:
    name: dev
    runtime: python3
    region: aws.euw1
    application-id: $YOUR_VONAGE_APPLICATION_ID
    entrypoint: [python3, main.py]
    capabilities:
        - messages-v1
    environment:
        - name: VONAGE_NUMBER
          value: "$YOUR_VONAGE_NUMBER"
debug:
    name: debug
    entrypoint: [nodemon, --exec, python3, -m, debugpy, --listen, localhost:9229, main.py]
```

Create a Python virtual environment, Python 3.10.5 or higher is required:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the Python virtual environment:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then start the project locally using:

```sh
neru debug
```

Now you text the number linked to your application.

To deploy use the `Makefile`:

```sh
make deploy
```

Or run the following commands:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --python-version 3.10.5 --platform manylinux2014_x86_64 --only-binary=:all: --target=./vendor

neru deploy
```
